PREAMBLE

The original Fig-FORTH adaptation to the 6502 processor was done by
the Forth Interest Group.

I want to pay my sincere respects to all those FORTH enthusiasts and gurus,
who so selflessly have shared their wisdom and knowledge throughout the years.
My own career in programming has been rewarding and successful due to my early
contacts with FORTH, which gave me a solid and structured foundation for all
code I have produced thereafter.

I wish that this FORTH implementation for the X16 retro machine will bravely
walk along the same footsteps and give all readers their fair share of the
insights and positive encouragement I know FORTH can provide.
